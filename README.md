<h1>Lesson 01</h1>
<h2>What is TypeScript?</h2>
<h3>Ans:</h3>
<p>TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.</p>
<h2>Why should I use TypeScript?</h2>
<h3>Ans:</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.</p>

<p>TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.</p>

<p>For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.</p>

<p>TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.
</p>

<h2>How do I use TypeScript?
</h2>
<p>A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.
